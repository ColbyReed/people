Charles Allen, his wife, Jordi Hutchinson, and their children, Cora Neal and Everett, live at 15th and D Streets, NE.
For over a decade, Charles has worked in Ward 6 neighborhoods, helping bring about school reforms, working with small businesses, and improving our community. His years of public service to Ward 6 mean he knows and understands our neighborhood issues like no one else.
What makes our neighborhoods so special is that people choose to make Ward 6 home, whether for five generations or just in the last five years – because our neighborhoods are an extension of our front steps. Ward 6 shares a vision of great schools we can walk to, thriving local businesses that know us by name, parks and playgrounds for our families, and safe streets for all. But we must ensure all our neighborhoods have these amenities, while protecting everyone’s ability to live, work, and raise a family in our community.
Charles began his career in the District as a graduate fellow with the federal Department of Health and Human Services, working on expanding community-based health options across the nation.  Charles quickly understood that to make true change he needed to return to his roots working at the local and community level, so he began his service to the District as policy director for the DC Primary Care Association, where he helped bring about legislative, budget, and policy changes that expanded health care options for almost every DC resident. Two of his signature efforts – bringing physicians, dentists, nurses and other healthcare providers to medically underserved communities and creating a District-owned captive insurance company to provide free and low-cost medical malpractice insurance to non-profit providers – remain a vital part of the city’s health care safety net a decade after he helped create them.
At the same time, Charles helped found DC for Democracy and served as Chair of the organization to bring a needed voice for progressive priorities and social justice issues facing the city.  These experiences led Charles to become an elected delegate for the District at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston, elected President of the Ward 6 Democrats, and serve as Chief of Staff to then-Ward 6 Councilmember Tommy Wells.
Charles is Chair of the Council’s Committee on the Judiciary and Public Safety, and is a member of the Council’s Committees on Education, Transportation and the Environment, and Business and Economic Development.  He serves as Chair of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments’ Transportation Planning Board and was named an Early Learning Fellow by the National Conference of State Legislatures.  He also serves on the NCSL’s standing committees on Education, Natural Resources & Infrastructure, and Law, Criminal Justice, & Public Safety.

After nearly two decades as a reporter, budget analyst, and community activist, she is excited to put her experience to work as an at-large member of the D.C. Council.
Elissa began her professional life as a reporter at the Washington City Paper near the end of Marion Barry’s fourth term as mayor and the beginning of Anthony A. Williams’ first. For three years she authored the paper’s “Loose Lips” column on D.C. politics. She later worked for The Washington Post, covering local business, the 2006 mayoral race, and police, fire, and emergency medical services as a reporter on the night shift.
From 2009 to 2014, Elissa worked for the D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute, analyzing the city’s budget, leading advocacy campaigns, and heading a coalition that opened D.C. Council budget negotiations to the public. She also helped coordinate the campaigns that led to an increase in the D.C. minimum wage and an expansion of paid sick days to restaurant workers. In 2012, she helped lead the efforts of the D.C. Public Trust, the grassroots effort to ban direct corporate contributions and reform the city’s campaign finance system.
Elissa was honored in November 2012 with a Heschel Vision Award from the organization Jews United for Justice. Named after Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel, an influential theologian and leader in civil rights and social justice, this award recognizes individuals for their activism and moral intent. Honored along with Elissa was former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley.
Elissa grew up in Baltimore, Md., and is a proud graduate of the city’s public schools. She earned a bachelor’s degree in economics and history from Brown University, where her studies sparked a lifelong interest in urban policy and shaped her thinking on critical issues such as race, poverty, and economic justice.
Her work on these issues — and her frustration that a series of corruption scandals had consumed District government — compelled Elissa to run for the at-large council seat in the April 2013 special election She applied her reform efforts to her own campaign by not accepting corporate contributions and by championing key issues including paid sick days and a living wage. She finished a close second.
The following year Elissa decided once again to seek an at-large council seat, this time in the November 2014 general election as an independent candidate. Elissa won through the hard work of many volunteers and a broad coalition of support including police, firefighters, nurses, teachers, and labor unions; environmental advocacy and women’s rights organizations; and progressive organizations working for equity and social justice in D.C. Once again, her people-powered campaign accepted no corporate contributions and took no PAC money.
Elissa is a Ward 6 resident and owns a home in Capitol Hill near H Street NE. She is a longtime cyclist, a recreational tennis player, and a sometimes cook. She thanks her parents, Jack and Ruth, and her brother, Jonathan (a Ward 3 resident), for their love and support.",,,http://dccouncil.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/silverman2-125x125-c-default.jpg,http://dccouncil.us/council/elissa-silverman/,http://dccouncil.us/council/elissa-silverman/,,esilverman@dccouncil.us,202-724-7772,202-724-8087,,,,,,,,

As Chairman, Phil leads the Council on all legislative matters.  Phil also presides over the Committee of the Whole which has purview over matters concerning: the DC Auditor, the District’s budget, the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, federal relations, planning and zoning, procurement, regional bodies (Except WMATA and DC Water), the retirement system, statehood and the University of the District of Columbia.
Phil has been an active participant in District politics since 1975, when he became a member of the McLean Gardens Residents Association.  In that role he was a large part of the effort to save the 43-acre housing complex from destruction.  In 1978, Phil successfully ran for a seat on the Advisory Neighborhood Commission (ANC) and continued to serve as an ANC Commissioner until he took office as an At-Large Member of the Council.
Prior to becoming Chairman, Phil served eight years as Chair of the Council’s Committee on the Judiciary.  In this role, he was responsible for all legislation affecting criminal laws in the District, as well as oversight over the District’s public safety agencies–including the Metropolitan Police Department, Fire & Emergency Medical Services Department, and the Office of the Attorney General for the District of Columbia.
During his tenure on the Council, Phil has authored hundreds of laws.  Major accomplishments include: establishing an elected attorney general and an independent Department of Forensic Science (the city’s crime lab); authoring Budget Autonomy, the District’s gun control laws (post-Heller), marriage equality, Universal Paid Leave, and the District’s tree canopy protection law; recrafting Mayor Bowser’s homeless shelter pan to close DC General, and Mayor Gray’s plan to build the DC United Soccer Stadium; establishing the District’s first renewable portfolio standard for electricity generation; coordinating an increase in the minimum wage with Montgomery and Prince Georges Counties; and implementing the recommendations of the 2012 Tax Revision Commission that has made the District’s income tax one of the most progressive in the nation and that has reduced the business franchise tax by almost 20%.  For Fiscal Year 2019, Phil secured dedicated funding for the arts and tax relief targeted to small DC retailers.
Phil believes that government should be an honest, efficient deliverer of services, and that the District should help those least able to help themselves to develop the skills to become self-sufficient and end the cycle of poverty.  Phil believes that government must accomplish this without increasing the tax burdens already shouldered by our middle income residents.  Throughout his years of public service, Phil has maintained that the District, as the nation’s capital, should be a model of service delivery in public education, public safety, and public health.
Phil came to the District from Cleveland, Ohio in 1970 to obtain a Bachelor’s Degree in Political Science from American University.  He grew up in a family dedicated to public service.  His mother was a national crusader for nursing home reform.  His grandmother, who had been President of the Michigan State League of Women Voters, was appointed by President Roosevelt to the Federal Office of Price Administration, and was a founder of the Grand Rapids Urban League.
Phil has a daughter, Adelaide, and they live in Southeast DC.

These experiences allowed him to gain the knowledge and wisdom as an entrepreneur, which would serve him well later in life.
During Mr. White’s early teen years, he participated in the highly successful youth television program on BET, “Teen Summit”.  His time on the show enhanced his knowledge and passion for tackling social issues head on.  During his time on “Teen Summit”, Trayon created a lifelong friendship with another effective community leader, the late Jay Cooper.
Mr. White is a proud father, community advocate, as well as humanitarian to his fellow Ward 8 neighbors.  He graduated with a 3.7 GPA and honors from Frank W. Ballou Senior High School and continued his education at the University of Maryland Eastern Shore, graduating magna cum laude with a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration.  While enrolled at the University of Maryland, Mr. White dedicated himself to the children of the neighborhood, in which he was raised, by making weekly trips home, to coach little league football at Boys & Girls Club No. 11 & FBR for at risk youth.  He was heavily involved in the nonprofit, “East of the River Clergy, Police and Community Partnership”, which created a platform to do youth violence intervention in the community.  Mr. White built great relationships and the trust of the community.  He also demonstrates his commitment to accessible education to the village of Ward 8 by mentoring them from grade school to college.
In 2008, Mr. White founded and continued to serve until recently as Executive Director of a youth oriented non-profit organization, HICKS, Inc. (Helping Inner City Kids Succeed), which creates activities for youth development in some of Washington’s toughest neighborhoods. In 2010, Mr. White was awarded the President Barack Obama Volunteer Service Award.
The year 2011 was one of great accomplishments, as Mr. White was elected to the State Board of Education for Ward 8 to complete the term of the late William Lockridge.  Mr. White was re-elected in 2012.
Even after his time on the State School Board of Education, Mr. White’s work in the community is well documented with its positive influence on 300 youth annually.  Mr. White is also known for his common sense approach and business acumen that show youth the correct pathway to successful living, personally and professionally.
He really enjoys being a community leader and positive example for all youth in Ward 8 and across this Nation’s Capitol.   In 2015, he ran for the DC Council to represent Ward 8 to fill the seat of the late Marion Barry.  He lost by less than 80 votes. In 2016, Mr. White upset the incumbent by energizing non-traditional voters through his “We the People” campaign.  On January, 2, 2017, Mr. White was sworn in as the Ward 8 Councilmember.",,,http://dccouncil.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/tw-125x125-c-default.jpg,http://dccouncil.us/council/councilmember-trayon-white-sr/,http://dccouncil.us/council/councilmember-trayon-white-sr/,,twhite@dccouncil.us,202-724-8045,202-724-8055,,,,,,,,

 has tirelessly advocated for the residents of the District of Columbia for more than 30 years. His dedication to children and their families has been the hallmark of his service. His lifetime of public service to the District can be best summed up by a singular governing philosophy—that the District of Columbia works best as “One City.” On November 8, 2016, Vincent C. Gray was again elected to represent his home ward on the Council of the District of Columbia.
On January 11, 2011, he was sworn in as the sixth elected Mayor of the District of Columbia. Mayor Gray ran for office on a platform of restoring fiscal responsibility to city government, creating jobs and boosting economic development, providing a quality public education to all District children, and building safe communities. Throughout his four years in office, Mayor Gray aggressively moved the District forward towards his vision of a more prosperous, equitable, safe, and sustainable city for all.
Gray began his professional career with the Arc of DC (then known as the Association for Retarded Citizens), then in 1991, then-Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly appointed Gray the Director of the Department of Human Services where he oversaw the functions of a 7,000 person department related to Public Health, Social Services, Mental Health Services and Health Care Finance In December 1994, he became the founding Executive Director of Covenant House Washington, an international, faith-based organization dedicated to serving homeless and at-risk youth.
Gray’s dedication to his community and the residents of Ward 7 inspired his first successful campaign for elected office in 2004, when he handily defeated the incumbent in the primary. During his first term, he chaired the Special Committee on the Prevention of Youth Violence, and created the Effi Barry HIV/AIDS Initiative. Two years after joining the Council, Gray ran for the citywide office of Chairman of the Council. Running on the theme of “One City,” he continued his focus on uniting the diverse racial and economic groups in his hometown. As Chairman, Gray spearheaded the Pre-K Expansion and Enhancement Act, which established a high-quality early childhood education program to provide 2,000 new classroom slots for three-and four-years-olds over six years. Gray’s diligence resulted in that goal being met in September 2010, well before the 2014 target.
Gray has lived in the Hillcrest neighborhood of Ward 7 for more than 25 years. His wife, Loretta, an outstanding educator in the DC Public Schools, passed away from cancer in 1998. He has two children, Jonice Gray Tucker and Vincent Carlos Gray, and two grandchildren.",,,http://dccouncil.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Headshot_gray_small-125x125-c-default.jpg,http://dccouncil.us/council/vincent-gray/,http://dccouncil.us/council/vincent-gray/,,vgray@dccouncil.us,202-724-8068,,,,,,,,,
