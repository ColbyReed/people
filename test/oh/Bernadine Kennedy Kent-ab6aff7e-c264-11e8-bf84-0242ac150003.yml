  biography: "Rep. Kent was born and raised in East Chicago, Indiana, a steel mill\
    \ union city. Her parents, like many African Americans of the time, migrated from\
    \ the South for better opportunities in the North. Her father could not read or\
    \ write. Her mother went to the third grade, and yet, they bought a home and raised\
    \ five children. All children graduated from high school and two went on to graduate\
    \ from Central State University. Rep. Kent\u2019s husband, whose own father was\
    \ a Tuskegee Airman, served his country as a Green Beret in Vietnam.\_"
